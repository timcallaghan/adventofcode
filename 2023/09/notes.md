```text
0   3   6   9  12  15
  3   3   3   3   3
    0   0   0   0
```

```text
0   3   6   9  12  15   B
  3   3   3   3   3   A
    0   0   0   0   0
```

In this case:

* A - 3 = 0 => A = 0 + 3
* B - 15 = A => B = A + 15 = 0 + 3 + 15 = 18

Therefore, the predicted value should ALWAYS be the sum of all of the final values for each row of differences
