Finding points inside the pipe loop using edge crossings involves realising that certain patterns do or don't correspond to a vertical pipe segment.

For example `|` is clearly a vertical pipe segment.

However `F----7` is _not_ a vertical pipe segment.

Similarly `L------J` is also not a vertical pipe segment.

To compute pipe crossings the segment must be a vertical pipe segment.
